Breakout Instructions and Reports

During the workshop we will have 4 breakout sessions labeled A, B, C, and D. In each of these sessions we anticipate having 4-5 tables of parallel discussions on topics dynamically selected by the community. 

Each of these discussion groups will have a scribe, a moderator, and a reporter. The scribe will be responsible for COORDINATING the input of the session in a Google Doc. We say coordinating because it is our hope that the whole table participates in this like a group blog making the scribes task less painful. To make the scribe’s job easier, we have pre-created the Google Docs and also filled each of those docs with prompts. Below, we have included links to four folders, one associated with each session, containing these folders. In this way, this document will provide a quick link for the scribe’s browser. The moderator will be responsible for moderating the discussion within a discussion group, while the reporter will provide a 5-minute overview to the entire workshop.

For each discussion group, the scribe will be chosen as the individual with the closest birthday before a random date selected for the session, and the moderator will be chosen as the individual with the closest birthday after the random date. Each discussion group will select their own reporter.

During the report-back period, the document will be displayed for each breakout to provide the reporter a visual queue to guide the 5 minute-per-group report back on that session-table discussion. It may be helpful for the group to read over and bold the most important points or prepare a summary at the bottom during the last few minutes of the discussion to make the reporter’s job a bit easier.
